        <p>More details: <br><br>The Diglett Pokémon card is part of the original Base Set released by Wizards of the Coast in 1999. It features Diglett, a Ground-type Pokémon, with an illustration by Ken Sugimori that shows Diglett emerging from the ground. The card has 30 HP and includes two moves: "Dig" and "Scratch." "Dig" allows Diglett to avoid attacks on the next turn, while "Scratch" deals basic damage to the opponent's Pokémon. Diglett is known for its simplicity and is a common card, making it less valuable compared to rare holographic cards. However, it holds nostalgic value for collectors of the original set. This card also highlights Diglett's evolution into Dugtrio.</p>
