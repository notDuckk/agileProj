        More details: <br /><br />The Clefairy Pokémon card is part of the
        original Base Set, released by Wizards of the Coast in 1999. It features
        Clefairy, a Fairy-type Pokémon, depicted as a Normal type in the early
        sets. The card's artwork, created by Mitsuhiro Arita, showcases Clefairy
        standing in a night setting with stars in the background. It has a
        holographic foil treatment, making it one of the more visually appealing
        cards in the set. Clefairy has 40 HP, with "Sing" and "Metronome" as its
        two moves. "Sing" can put the opponent's Pokémon to sleep, while
        "Metronome" allows Clefairy to copy any of the defending Pokémon's
        moves. As a collectible, the card holds significant nostalgic and
        monetary value, especially in mint condition. It is also notable for
        evolving into Clefable, another Pokémon from the original 151.
