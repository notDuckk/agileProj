        More details: <br /><br />The Piplup Pokémon card is part of the Pokémon
        Trading Card Game (TCG). Piplup is a Water-type Pokémon, often depicted
        as a cute, penguin-like creature. The card typically features artwork of
        Piplup in aquatic or icy environments. It has moves such as "Pound" and
        "Bubble," which are basic Water-type attacks. Piplup evolves into
        Prinplup and then into Empoleon. This card has appeared in several TCG
        expansions, including the Diamond & Pearl series. Piplup cards are
        popular for their charming design and connection to the Sinnoh region
        starter Pokémon from Generation IV. They are commonly used in Water-type
        themed decks and are appreciated by collectors for their appealing
        artwork and playability.
