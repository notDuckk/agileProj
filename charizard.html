        More details: <br /><br />The Charizard Pokémon card is one of the most
        iconic and valuable cards in the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG).
        Charizard is a Fire/Flying-type Pokémon, first appearing in the Base Set
        released in 1999. The card features Charizard in a powerful, flying pose
        with flames surrounding it. It boasts a high HP (Hit Points) of 120 and
        includes potent moves like "Fire Spin," requiring significant Energy
        cards but dealing massive damage. The Base Set Charizard, especially in
        its holographic form, is highly sought after by collectors and often
        commands high prices in the market. This card's popularity stems from
        its rarity, nostalgic value, and Charizard's status as a fan-favorite
        Pokémon. Various reprints and special editions, such as the Shining
        Charizard and Charizard GX, continue to be prized in the TCG community.
