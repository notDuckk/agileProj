        <p>More details: <br><br>The Pikachu Pokémon card is a beloved and iconic card in the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG). Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon, often depicted in a cheerful pose with sparks of electricity. The card has appeared in numerous sets since the TCG's inception in 1999, with varying artworks and moves. Common moves include "Thundershock" and "Quick Attack," which reflect Pikachu's Electric-type abilities. Pikachu cards are popular among collectors and players, especially due to Pikachu's status as the franchise's mascot. Special editions, such as the "Pikachu Illustrator" card and promotional releases, are particularly valuable. Pikachu cards are frequently included in themed decks and have a nostalgic appeal, making them a staple in any Pokémon card collection.</p>
